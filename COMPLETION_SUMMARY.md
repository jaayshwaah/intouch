## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns

- **Async/await**: For Contacts and StoreKit operations

### Performance
- Contact loading on background thread
- UI updates on main thread
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Efficient UserDefaults persistence

### User Experience
- **<30 second** time to first spin ✅
- Haptic feedback on all interactions
- Smooth animations with spring physics
- Glass morphism design (modern, elegant)
- Responsive layout (iPhone/iPad compatible)

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

```bash
1. Open InTouch.xcodeproj
2. Select iPhone 16 Pro simulator (or any iOS 18.5+ device)
3. Press Cmd+R
4. Grant Contacts permission when prompted
5. Tap Spin and watch it work!
```

### Test Free Tier
- Spin 3 times → see counter: "2 free spins remaining", then "1", then "0"
- On 4th spin → paywall appears

## 🎓 Key Code Locations

### Want to change the free spin limit?
**File**: `SubscriptionManager.swift`
**Line**: 23
```swift
private let maxFreeSpins = 3  // Change this number
```

### Want to change the notification default time?
**File**: `NotificationManager.swift`
**Line**: 17
```swift
let components = DateComponents(hour: 19, minute: 0)  // 19 = 7pm
```

### Want to change the notification message?
**File**: `NotificationManager.swift`
**Lines**: 67-68
```swift
content.title = "Time to reconnect!"
content.body = "Spin to see who you should reach out to today 🎲"
```

### Want to change the pricing?
**Location**: App Store Connect (not in code)
But update display in PaywallView.swift if needed

### Want to change product IDs?
**File**: `SubscriptionManager.swift`
**Lines**: 13-14

private let yearlyProductID = "com.joshking.InTouch.premium.yearly"
```

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

### Simulator
- Call/Text don't work (no Phone/Messages app)
- Haptics don't provide feedback
- Contacts need to be added manually

### Testing
- Subscriptions need App Store Connect setup
- Notifications need device (simulator works but limited)
- Daily reset requires time change or waiting until midnight

### Future Considerations
- Add CloudKit for backup/sync
- Add family sharing for subscription
- Add accessibility labels
- Add localization
